In lines of code, we craft with care,
Debug and test with patient flair.
Functions flow like poetry in motion,
While loops spin with endless devotion.
Through git commits and pull requests,
Our software grows and stands the test.

Binary and bytes in perfect array,
Algorithms guide us through each day.
From stack to heap, we build with might,
Making sure each feature works just right.
In this digital realm where we reside,
Clean code is our source of pride.
